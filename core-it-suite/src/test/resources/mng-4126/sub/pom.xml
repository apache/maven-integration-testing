  <description>
    Verify that effects of active profiles from the profiles.xml of a local parent are inherited by children when
    parent and child are build together during a reactor invocation. This boils down to the reactor cache not
    interfering with profile injection from profiles.xml by properly tracking the base directory of cached projects.
